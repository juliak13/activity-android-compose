ChatGPT and CoPilot for error handling 

I made a login/register pages  for an app in Swift last semester in Database Systems with Dr. Herbert, I took those pages and tried to convert them from Swift to Kotlin (I kept the some names of my files), however it didn't go perfect, so I had to use additional websites and videos to fix and verify setup along with ChatGPT and CoPilot.  

I used Firebase Authenticator last semester with that project, so I tried it again using Android instead of Apple. It works relatively the same.

Used my previous Type.kt and Color.kt (I prefer to have purple when I can)
